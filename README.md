### 🌟 Project Title
Pneumothorax Detection: AI-Driven Solutions for Early Diagnosis 🩺🤖

### 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the Pneumothorax Detection project, a pioneering application designed to revolutionize the early detection and diagnosis of pneumothorax (collapsed lung) using cutting-edge AI technology. By leveraging deep learning models, this tool aims to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals in identifying pneumothorax from chest X-ray images with high accuracy and efficiency.

### ✨ Features
- **🔍 AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms for accurate identification of pneumothorax.
- **🖼️ Image Analysis**: Analyzes chest X-ray images to detect signs of pneumothorax.
- **👩‍💻 User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for healthcare professionals.
- **📊 Real-Time Results**: Provides immediate analysis results to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

### 🎨 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer 🐍
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other dependencies 📚

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prtkmhn/Pneumothorax.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
